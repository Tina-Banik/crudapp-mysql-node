This is a simple yet robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js, Express.js for the backend, and MySQL as the relational database. This project serves as a foundational example for developing web APIs that interact with a database, demonstrating essential data manipulation operations.
Purpose:
To demonstrate basic CRUD operations using Node.js and MySQL.
To provide a clear, concise example of setting up a RESTful API.
To serve as a starting point for more complex Node.js/MySQL applications.
Features : 
Create: Add new records to the database.
Read: Retrieve single or all records from the database.
Update: Modify existing records in the database.
Delete: Remove records from the database.
RESTful API: Designed with clear and intuitive API endpoints.
Error Handling: Basic error handling for common scenarios.
Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
MySQL: Open-source relational database management system.
Nodemon (optional, for development): Automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected.
Dotenv (optional, but recommended): Loads environment variables from a .env file.
(List any other npm packages you've used, e.g., mysql2 for database interaction, body-parser)
